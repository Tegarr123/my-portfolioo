# **My Project Portfolio**

I have a deep passion for **building robust operational pipelines**, I specialize in architecting automated, end-to-end workflows for data, AI/ML, and software development lifecycles. 
I primarily leverage **the power and versatility of Python** to create efficient and scalable systems that streamline complex processes.

### [DevOps Project - CI/CD & GitOps Integration of Forked Flask App](https://github.com/Tegarr123/PSO-kelompok7-GymManagementSystem)

- Brief overview : I created a DevOps project by forking a repository containing a Flask framework-based application and implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. This pipeline automates the building, testing, and containerization of the application upon code changes. For deployment, I integrated a GitOps workflow with Argo CD to continuously monitor the application's configuration repository. Any updates to the Kubernetes manifests in the Git repository automatically trigger Argo CD to synchronize the state and deploy the new version of the Flask application to the Kubernetes cluster
- Technology used : Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes (Minikube), Argo CD, Prometheus & Grafana, Terraform, and AWS cloud
- Final Result : [*Source code of Project*](https://github.com/Tegarr123/PSO-kelompok7-GymManagementSystem)

### [Nusadata Data Warehousing Project - ETL Pipeline Written in Python](https://github.com/Tegarr123/nusadata-etl-script)

- Brief Overview : This project aims to comprehensively map the digital divide in Indonesia. The primary goal is to identify, evaluate, and analyze relevant datasets concerning digital access, with the potential to expand into digital usage, literacy, and equity impacts. My role in this team is a dashboard engineer whose responsbilities for designing and building ETL pipeline Script.
- Technology Used : Python, Pandas, Google Cloud API Service, Apache Airflow (Coming soon)
- Final Result : [*NusaData Data Warehouse*](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pWlpky-b2cOCJQyaAOgn4ao-1ddjzd6eEZ2AfVCyFsw/edit?usp=sharing)

### [Data Warehouse Course Mid-Term Project - SIM Magang ITS Data Warehouse & ETL Design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQm88bZVbhyBb3djz6_sZ_MamdKQSy5g/view?usp=sharing)

- Brief Overview : I created document detailing the design and implementation of a data warehouse (DW) for a university's independent internship program, focusing on two main business processes, the submission of final internship reports and the conversion of internship credits to course credits. I also built complex ETL flow with Pentaho as a Low-Code Data Integration tool, from data source [dummy] to data warehouse (mysql).
- Technology Used : MySQL, Pentaho
- Final Result : [*Project Document*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nQm88bZVbhyBb3djz6_sZ_MamdKQSy5g/view?usp=sharing)
