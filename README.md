# **My Project Portfolio**

I have a deep passion for **building robust operational pipelines**, I specialize in architecting automated, end-to-end workflows for data, AI/ML, and software development lifecycles. 
I primarily leverage **the power and versatility of Python** to create efficient and scalable systems that streamline complex processes.

### [DevOps Project - CI/CD & GitOps Integration of Forked Flask App](https://github.com/Tegarr123/PSO-kelompok7-GymManagementSystem)

- Brief overview : I created a DevOps project by forking a repository containing a Flask framework-based application and implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins. This pipeline automates the building, testing, and containerization of the application upon code changes. For deployment, I integrated a GitOps workflow with Argo CD to continuously monitor the application's configuration repository. Any updates to the Kubernetes manifests in the Git repository automatically trigger Argo CD to synchronize the state and deploy the new version of the Flask application to the Kubernetes cluster
- Technology used : Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes (Minikube), Argo CD, Prometheus & Grafana, Terraform, and AWS cloud
- Final Result : [*Source code of Project*](https://github.com/Tegarr123/PSO-kelompok7-GymManagementSystem)
